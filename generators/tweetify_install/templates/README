Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined your Twitter user name in config/tweetify.rb

  2. Ensure you have defined your Twitter search agent in config/tweetify.rb

  3. Run rake db:migrate to create the Tweets table.

Note: the initializer creates its own Rufus scheduler task - so if you have
other Rufus tasks, you may want to consolidate them.
